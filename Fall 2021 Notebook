Fall 2021 Notebook

Semester Goals:
  1. Create a server system to distribute 3D position estimation data across the cooper network. A server will need to be purchased and a LAN port opened for a MySQL server
    using the created database structure used to send/receive data in real-time to multiple devices.
  2. Fix Marvin, solving his boundary issues and switching from Kinect cameras to USB webcams running my algorithm. This will require rewriting the motor controller
    using ROS or Arduino and moving the system from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04.
    
Weekly Updates:

Week 1:
  Back to Cooper! Mostly focused on settling in and learning more about Marvin.
Week 2:
  Finalized database structure for MySQL. It uses a schema called keypoint_management consisting of individual tables for each body, which stores keypoint_id and keypoint_value
  as the appropriate database. Worked on modeling a head for Marvin in Solidworks; need to measure Kinects to create modular design.
