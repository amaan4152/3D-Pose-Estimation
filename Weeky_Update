Weekly Update
Amaan and Aaron

---------Week 1----------
  Aaron created a working model of a 3D pose estimator
using two USB cameras, OpenCV and OpenPose over the summer.
Amaan created this GitHub and worked on creating an implementation of
multithreading using OpenPose.
---------Week 2----------
  Aaron presented his work to NIST on 9/8, and Amaan finished his 
multithreading implementation. Aaron also created a task list
to assign and track upcoming tasks.
---------Week 3----------
  Aaron revised his pose estimation program to include hand support,
allow for easy switching between keypoints and created more well-defined
user options. Amaan fully implemented his multithreading into Aaron's
code, so that a single unified program was created.
---------Week 4----------
  Aaron researched GUI work environments to use with the program, and
Amaan worked on Blender support to visualize the 3D keypoint output.
The GUI was narrowed down to two choices: electronJS and Qt.
