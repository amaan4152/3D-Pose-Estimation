WEEKLY UPDATE - AARON AND AMAAN - SPRING SEMESTER

-----Week 1-----
Aaron figured out how to generate and implement DLLs, allowing C++ code to work through Unity and its C# scripting. See 
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/integrating-native-c-c-libraries-with-unity-as-plugins-a-step-by-step-guide-17ad70c2e3b4
as a guideline to do so. He also worked through creating new project files (required for DLLs) through Visual Studio 2017
that work with OpenPose using https://github.com/quickgrid/Setup-Guide/blob/master/README.md#windows-10-cmu-openpose-setup-visual-studio-2019-cmake-nvidia-gpu .
NOTE: the installation method is untested, only the visual studio setup is.

Amaan attempted to setup a camera space in the lab at Cooper, but the Autonomy Lab laptop had issues with making
the Openpose build due to "pthreads" library issues; this is a resolvable problem, probably due to the library not being 
in PATH, needs Caffe dependency installed separately, or needs updates.

-----Week 2-----
Aaron started working on a unity skeleton rig. The current plan is to use the multi-position constraint and the multi-rotation constraint in conjunction with
the c++ program to work in real time with an interactive skeleton, while also adding on the Oculus head as the 'base' of the rig.

Amaan configured the Aaron-Amaan code in the Linux system; setup Blender code as well. Still working on Blender documentation writeup.
Was reading upon different calibration methods; currently working on calibrating the stereo camera setup with the laptop at Cooper
and packaging the Blender demo program.

-----Week 3-----
Amaan met up with Lucia and Esther to discuss a plan on how to automate annotation process to generate a training dataset. In search for existing 
automated annotation programs and currently developing a program to setup an automated annotation program.
